# [Code Maron: Global Edition](https://yash8005.github.io/code-maroon-report/)

Information retrieval is a critical component of crisis response, but it's not always easy to find reliable sources in the midst of chaos. Rumors, gossip, and wild speculation run rampant, leaving authorities scrambling to sort fact from fiction. In this scenario, there is a need for a global, reliable and user friendly application to provide quick and accurate facts to the general masses. This task is from 2022 TREC CrisisFACTs Track: https://crisisfacts.github.io/

## Features
